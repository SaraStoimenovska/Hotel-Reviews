This is the sollution of Challenge-hotel-api written in Angular 6

To run it:
Open the folder in any IDE you prefer
from command line, navigate to challenge-hotel-api folder
run   npm install   to instal the dependencies
run   ng serve   to start the application
open the application in browser (preferred Incognito because of the cache)
http://localhost:4200/login

in environment, the apiUrl is set to http://192.168.99.100:8000 because my docker machine runs on that url and port
if you need to change it, do it here (in environment.ts file)

there are some tests in Jasmine, to run it:
ng test --code-coverage
with --code-coverage, a folder coverage is created
open the index.html in a browser to see which branches and statements are covered

Thanks in advance
